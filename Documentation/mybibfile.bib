abstract = "This paper presents a new phenomenological model of annular two-phase flow with dryout prediction capability, implemented in the CATHARE-3 system code. The model comprises existing correlations for entrainment and deposition rates and a new equation to determine the initial entrained fraction (IEF) of the liquid phase at the onset of annular two-phase flow. The proposed new model allows for a significant reduction of mean error variations with pressure and mass flux, when compared with measured dryout in pipes with internal diameter from 8 to 14.9 mm, system pressure from 3 to 10 MPa, mass flux from 500 to 6000 kg/m2s, test section length from 1 to 7 m, inlet subcooling form 10 to 100 K, and critical heat flux from 0.15 to 3.90 MW/m2. It has been also shown that, at certain conditions, the phenomenological model is unable to provide an accurate prediction, irrespective of the chosen value for the IEF parameter. Such behavior is thoroughly investigated in this paper and seldom addressed in the literature, even though it sets limits on the applicability of the model to dryout predictions."

abstract = "Uncertainties of numerical predictions play important role in assessment of safety margins in nuclear reactors. In this
paper uncertainties of the predictions of the Hewitt-Govan model, which is used to determine the entrainment and
deposition rates in phenomenological dryout model, are presented and discussed. Results of the Global Uncertainty
Analysis are shown in terms of trends of uncertainty values with respect to the pressure, mass flux and inlet subcooling.
Regions of large and small uncertainties are identified and presented in a tabular form.
Application of the Global Sensitivity Analysis methods allowed to quantify the sources of uncertainties with high
accuracy over large spectrum of experimental conditions. Since the computational demand for such analysis was signif-
icant DARIA system code, with three-field model of misture flow has been developed along with the present analysis.
The most important implication of the presented work is that, when applying the current methodology to predict CHF
in rod bundles, the most important parameter, affecting the accuracy of predictions, is the distribution of coolant flow
between sub-channels."
